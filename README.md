# Basic node server with nodemon and linting

Quickly spin up a node instance that automatically reloads on save.

```
mkdir new-project && cd new-project
degit bennforlife/node-noodle
npm install
npm run start
```

Beats messing around in the browser console -> you get to keep your vim key bindings.
